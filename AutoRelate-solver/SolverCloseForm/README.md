test cases to solve equations for Auto-Relate, in the hope that we could use symbolic computation, to find equivalent classes for table values, for close-form solutions of 'perturbation-based' stability-test of inferred formulas
\n did not succeed, in getting desired solutions, it is always a hit and miss
